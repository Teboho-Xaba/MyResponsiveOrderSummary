# MyResponsiveOrderSummary

My first project without using a tutorial or anything since my hiatus.
Takeaways from this project:

- I'm rusty but doing more projects will solve that and I'll be back to my full potential.
- I REALLY need to code more, suggestion 25+hrs/day
- Work more on my responsive designs
- Select better images and icons
- Don't be afraid to change designs just a little bit from the tutorials.
- KEEP CODING
